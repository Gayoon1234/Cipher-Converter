# Final Update
This repository is no longer being worked on :(
With the exception of the Vigenere Cipher all other 
cipers can be directly implemented in any JavaScript based framework.

# Converters and Ciphers

~This is a passion project currently still in development.~ \
It is a rails 6 project with ruby 3.0.1, however most of the current
converters/ciphers are written in javascript. \
\
~It is currently hosted at: https://vast-wave-08456.herokuapp.com/~ \
